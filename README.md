INTRODUCTION
Context
The dataset used in this project originates from a leading E-commerce company that operates an online retail platform. As part of their customer retention strategy, the company aims to proactively identify customers who are likely to churn—i.e., stop using their services or placing new orders.

In the highly competitive world of online shopping, customer loyalty and retention are critical to long-term profitability. Losing a customer not only impacts immediate revenue but also increases customer acquisition costs due to the need to replace lost users. To mitigate this risk, the company wants to predict churn behavior based on various customer attributes such as order history, satisfaction score, complaint records, and cashback habits.

By identifying high-risk churn customers in advance, the business can implement targeted marketing campaigns, personalized promotions, and proactive outreach to retain them—maximizing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and reducing revenue leakage.

This project aims to build a classification model that can accurately distinguish between customers likely to stay and those likely to churn, enabling the company to take data-driven action toward improving customer retention.

PROBLEM
The E-commerce company is currently unable to identify customers who are at risk of churning. As a result, they are reactive rather than proactive in their retention strategies, often realizing customer loss only after it occurs. This leads to decreased revenue, reduced customer lifetime value, and increased marketing costs to reacquire lost users.

The challenge is to build a predictive machine learning model that can classify whether a customer is likely to churn (1) or not churn (0) based on their historical behavior, preferences, satisfaction level, and transaction patterns.

GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT
Build a classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (1) or not (0) based on behavioral, transactional, and satisfaction-related features.

Focus on high recall, so the model can accurately identify most customers at risk of churning—allowing the business to act before it's too late.

Ensure model explainability and trustworthiness, enabling stakeholders to understand the reasons behind predictions and when the model can or cannot be relied on.
